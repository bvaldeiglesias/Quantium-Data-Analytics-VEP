# Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program

Here's my attempt at the [Quantium Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program](https://www.insidesherpa.com/virtual-internships/NkaC7knWtjSbi6aYv) at Inside Sherpa.


## Task 1: Data preparation and customer analytics

> Conduct analysis on your client's transaction dataset and identify customer purchasing behaviours to generate insights and provide commercial recommendations.

Here I had the chance to analyze previously unexplored datasets about retail transaction and customer purchase behavior, and their relations. I go through the steps of data exploration, cleaning, and merging to later analyze it and find key insights and metric of interest for a retail manager, making sure to communicate in a non-technical way and with visualizations to express my findings.
